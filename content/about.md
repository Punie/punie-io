# Why?

As you might have guessed already, I find myself thinking about types and type systems a lot. Probably a little _too much_. At least from the perspective of my delightful girlfriend, I talk about them **way too much**. Unfortunately, I can't help it. So there you go: my number one reason for starting this whole thing was so I could share the type love with a broader (and more receptive) audience.

It's not the **only** reason though. As I have been struggling, for most of my life, to express my thoughts in a way that is coherent and clear, I figured that taking the time to write stuff might be a great exercise.

Something something something.
